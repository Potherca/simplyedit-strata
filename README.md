Quoting from the readme of [the original demo]:

> A simple, minimalist template that actually began life as an unused redesign of my
> personal site. Includes a (configurable) parallax background effect, Poptrox-powered
> lightbox gallery, a bunch of pre-styled elements, and Sass sources for the Sass-inclined.
>
> Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)
